    <string name="string_step_1"><![CDATA[<b>Step 1:</b>]]> Make sure you are covering your awrah at the very least and that you have performed <![CDATA[<b>wudu</b>]]>. Men should cover their entire body, including their navel and knees. A woman\'s body must be covered everywhere but her hands, feet, and face.</string>
    <string name="string_step_2"><![CDATA[<b>Step 2:</b>]]> Look for a spotless area where you won\'t bother other people, such as on a prayer mat. Faced towards the Ka\'bah in Makkah, this is the direction of the Qiblah. You can pray while seated if you are sick or disabled and cannot stand.</string>
    <string name="string_step_3"><![CDATA[<b>Step 3:</b>]]> Declare your intention for the Salah either aloud or silently to start. You can do this in Arabic or in the language of your choice. Declare, \"I intend to pray two rak’at for Tarawih for Allah facing the Ka’bah\".</string>
    <string name="string_step_4"><![CDATA[<b>Step 4:</b>]]> Say <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Allahu Akbar\"</i></b>]]> and raise your hands to your shoulders for women and your earlobes for men. \"Allah is the Greatest,\" this signifies. (This step is shown below). You are currently in a state of ihram, which prohibits you from doing anything earthly that could divert your attention, including chatting, laughing, eating, drinking, or thinking about anything.</string>
    <string name="string_step_5"><![CDATA[<b>Step 5:</b>]]> Man place your right hand over your left, just below the naval. Women should place their hands over their chest.</string>
    <string name="string_step_6"><![CDATA[<b>Step 6:</b>]]> Quietly say this sentence <![CDATA[<b><i>\"SubhanaK-Allahumma wa bihamdiKa,<br>wa tabaarak-asmuKa, wa ta-‘aala jadduKa, wa la ilaaha illa ghayruK\"</i></b>]]>. This signifies \"O Allah, glory and praise are for You; blessed is Your Name; exalted is Your Majesty; there is no god but You\"</string>
    <string name="string_step_7"><![CDATA[<b>Step 7:</b>]]> Afterward, softly recite: <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Auudhu bi-Llahi min ash-Shaitaanir rajeem bismi-Llahir Rahmaani Raheem\"</i></b>]]>. This implies \"I ask Allah for protection from Satan, the accursed one, invoking the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful\".</string>
    <string name="string_step_8"><![CDATA[<b>Step 8:</b>]]> Continue to recite: <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Surah al-Fatihah\"</i></b>]]>, then conclude with <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Amin\"</i></b>]]>, signifying \"may it be granted\". If you\'re leading a prayer, make sure to recite all Surahs in Tarawih aloud!</string>
    <string name="string_step_9"><![CDATA[<b>Step 9:</b>]]> Afterwards, recite any other Surah. The minimum recitation is three verses, or one lengthy verse equivalent to three shorter ones. Yet, it\'s preferable to recite an entire Surah.</string>
    <string name="string_step_10"><![CDATA[<b>Step 10:</b>]]> Bend forward and utter <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Allahu Akbar\"</i></b>]]>, meaning \"Allah is the Greatest\", placing your hands on your knees, maintaining a straight back. Pause in this position, known as Ruku (bowing), and repeat <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Subhaana Rabbiy-al-Adheem\"</i></b>]]> at least three times, meaning \"Glory be to my Lord, the Great\".</string>
    <string name="string_step_11"><![CDATA[<b>Step 11:</b>]]> When rising to a fully upright position again, proclaim, <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Sami-Allahu liman hamidaH\"</i></b>]]> - \"Allah heard the one who praised Him\". Following that, declare, <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Rabbana laKal hamd\"</i></b>]]> - \"O our Lord, all praise belongs to You\".</string>
    <string name="string_step_12"><![CDATA[<b>Step 12:</b>]]> Once more, say <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Allahu Akbar\"</i></b>]]> and lower into prostration, known as \"Sujood\". While prostrating, ensure your forehead, nose, palms of both hands, knees, and toes pointing forward make contact with the floor.</string>
    <string name="string_step_13"><![CDATA[<b>Step 13:</b>]]> Repeat at least three times, <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Subhaana Rabbiy-al-Aalaa\"</i></b>]]> - \"Glory be to my Lord, the Highest\".</string>
    <string name="string_step_14"><![CDATA[<b>Step 14:</b>]]> Rise to a sitting position while saying <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Allahu Akbar\"</i></b>]]>. Place the palms of your hands on your knees. Sit on the flat of your left foot, keeping the toes of the right foot planted and pointing forward. For women, lean on their left hip with both feet pointing to the right side.</string>
    <string name="string_step_15"><![CDATA[<b>Step 15:</b>]]> After a brief pause, return to prostration while saying <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Allahu Akbar\"</i></b>]]>, and repeat step 13.</string>
    <string name="string_step_16"><![CDATA[<b>Step 16:</b>]]> Rise to a full standing position while saying <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Allahu Akbar\"</i></b>]]>. You have now finished your first unit, or rak‘ah, of Tarawih.</string>
    <string name="string_step_17"><![CDATA[<b>Step 17:</b>]]> Repeat steps 8 through 15 once more.</string>
    <string name="string_step_18"><![CDATA[<b>Step 18:</b>]]> After completing steps 8 through 15 again, return to a sitting position as described in step 14.</string>
    <string name="string_step_19"><![CDATA[<b>Step 19:</b>]]> While in a seated position, recite the initial segment of the Tashaahud: <![CDATA[<b><i>\"At-tahiyyatu lillah, was-salawaatu wat-tayyibaat. As-salaamu ‘alayka ayyuhan-Nabiyyu wa rahmat-Ullahi wa barakaatu. As-salaamu alayna, wa alaa ibaadi-llahis saaliheen\"</i></b>]]>. This means \"All compliments are for Allah, and prayers and goodness. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us and on the righteous servants of Allah.\"</string>
    <string name="string_step_20"><![CDATA[<b>Step 20:</b>]]> Next, with your hands resting on your knees, lift your right index finger while holding the other fingers of your right hand together. Then, recite the second portion of the Tashaahud: <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Ashhadu an laa ilaaha ill-Allahu wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan abduHu wa Rasooluh\"</i></b>]]>. This signifies \"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger\".</string>
    <string name="string_step_21"><![CDATA[<b>Step 21:</b>]]> Lower your right index finger, returning both palms to rest on your knees</string>
    <string name="string_step_22"><![CDATA[<b>Step 22:</b>]]> While remaining seated, recite: <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Allahumma salli alaa Muhammadiw wa alaa aali Muhammadin, kamaa sallayta alaa Ibraheema wa alaa aali Ibraheema, innaKa Hameedum Majeed. Allahumma baarik ‘alaa Muhammadiw wa alaa aali Muhammadin, kamaa baarakta alaa Ibraheema wa alaa aali Ibraheema, innaKa Hameedum Majeed\"</i></b>]]>. This translates to \"O Allah, send Your mercy upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, just as You sent mercy upon Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim. Truly You are Praiseworthy and Glorious. O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, just as You sent blessings upon Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim. Truly You are Praiseworthy and Glorious\".</string>
    <string name="string_step_23"><![CDATA[<b>Step 23:</b>]]> It is highly recommended to recite some supplications (dua). One straightforward and comprehensive supplication is, <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Rabbana aatina fid-dunya hasanataw wa fil-aakhirati hasantaw wa qina adhaaban Naar\"</i></b>]]>. This means \"O our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the hereafter and protect us from the punishment of the Fire\".</string>
    <string name="string_step_24"><![CDATA[<b>Step 24:</b>]]> Conclude the Salah by turning your head to the right, saying <![CDATA[<b><i>\"Assalamu alaikum wa rahmat-Ullahi wa barakaatuH\"</i></b>]]>. Then repeat these words while turning your head to the left. They mean, \"May peace, the mercy of Allah, and His blessings be upon you\".</string>
